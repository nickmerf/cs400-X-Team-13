# X-Team NN Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks



## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
- Check in every few days at least to make sure we are staying on schedule.
- Let other members know when a task has been completed.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
- Let everyone know what exactly is going on and be honest. 
- Don't be rude to teammates who are struggling while also giving effort.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

- If a response is required on some group communication, trying to acheive no more than a 48 hour turn arround time
- Striving to complete assignments at least 1 day prior to the deadline to allow time for review and submission
- Assisting each other as needed when difficulties occur
